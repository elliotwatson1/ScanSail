Building an app for a sailing club

DESCRIPTION
This project expects the student to conduct independent research into relevant areas. 
Guidance will be provided however this is your project and you should make it your own. Below 
I have provided the project idea, how this is implemented is down to you.
Sailing clubs traditionally use pen & paper for the recording of race results, 
these are then manually typed into SailWave (https://www.sailwave.com/) so that the final 
results can be calculated and published. This whole process could be speed up through the use 
of an Android application. Users should be able to quickly and easily record race results and these 
are they processed and uploaded or sent to the relevant end point. Sailors tend to be quite tech illiterate 
and therefor a very simple UI with extremely small margins for error needs to be implemented. 
An alternative application would be to replace SailWave. So the member still use the traditional 
method to record the race results but the project is a method for capturing the hand written notes 
(hardware and/or software) in a quick and easy manner and then produce to results in a format ready to be 
uploaded to the sailing club website.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Want to implement an app similar to strava in a sense where it tracks your location and time and then once 
you are complete it should automatically send it to SailWave to where you can view the results.
You hopefully will be able to add friends and images of the place etc so your in app friends can see where's
nice to sail. Also the way that races are timed is very old fashioned with a simple timer. Would be cool
to implement a function where you could set up a start and end radius zones to automatically time.

Could use android studio which is the IDE and you use Java within that.

or a pdf scanner app that scans a piece of paper with results, names etc and then send it to sailwave

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or a app that you can talk the results into and then it uses AI to understand the words and creates a form which 
is then sent to sailwave

                            "docs.expo.dev" = build the app in react js with expo

Sailing races are traditionally recorded through a combination of methods to ensure accurate documentation and analysis. Some common methods include:

Manual Observation: Race officials stationed on boats or at vantage points around the course manually record the positions, times, and maneuvers of each participating sailboat. They may use binoculars, cameras, or simply written notes to track the progress of the race.
GPS Tracking: Many modern sailing races utilize GPS tracking devices installed on each sailboat. These devices transmit real-time data on the boats' positions, speed, and course, allowing race organizers and spectators to monitor the race's progress on electronic displays or through online platforms.
Photography and Videography: Photographers and videographers stationed on boats, helicopters, or drones capture visual documentation of the race. These images and videos can provide valuable insights into the tactics, strategies, and performance of the competing sailboats.
Race Management Software: Race organizers often use specialized software designed for managing sailing races. These software platforms help track participant registration, calculate race results based on various handicapping systems, and generate reports on race statistics and performance metrics.
Onboard Cameras and Sensors: Some sailboats are equipped with onboard cameras and sensors that record data such as boat speed, wind direction, and sail trim. This data can be analyzed after the race to evaluate individual and team performance and identify areas for improvement.
Radio Communication: Race officials and competitors may communicate via radio to relay important information such as course changes, penalties, or safety alerts. These communications may also be recorded for reference or dispute resolution purposes.
By combining these methods, sailing races can be accurately recorded and analyzed to ensure fair competition and enhance the overall spectator experience.
